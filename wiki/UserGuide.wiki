= Introduction =

This plugin aims to render as PDF or HTML reports built on JasperReport (or IReport) in a very simple way.

== Why this plugin? ==

  *  Legacy reports are more likely to expect simple parameters and use big/complex SQL queries.
  *  Most developers prefer build reports using IReport IDE and SQL Queries. Even more when we are talking about subreports.
  *  Refactor reports built on "parameters -> report" approach to "model -> report" is hard taks. Again, even more when we are talking about subreports.

= Usage Example =

After install the plugin and its dependencies, let's do the following...

== 1. Build a JaperReport using IReport ==
It's a simple report that waits for one parameter (*_"name"_*).

== 2. Build the "BeeController" and the "report" action ==

== 3. Build the "index.gsp" on "views/bee" folder ==
We could use GSP or HTML tags. The important is reach *report()* method at *BeeController*.

See that we have a *name* parameter sent to controller. Why *name*? Because *name* is the expected parameter in JasperReport file.

== 4. Run the application, and test ==
Access _http://host:port/context/bee/_
