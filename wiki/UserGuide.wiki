= Introduction =

This plugin aims to render as PDF or HTML reports built on JasperReport or IReport.

== Why this plugin? ==

  *  Legacy reports are more likely to expect simple parameters and use big/complex SQL queries.
  *  Most developers prefer build reports using IReport IDE and SQL Queries. Even more when we are talking about subreports.
  *  Refactor reports built on "parameters -> report" approach to "model -> report" is hard taks. Again, even more when we are talking about subreports.
